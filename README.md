# Go WhiteNoise
Golang implementation of the WhiteNoise Protocol.
## WhiteNoise Protocol
WhiteNoise is an overlay privacy network protocol. It is designed to provide comprehensive network privacy protection, including link privacy, node privacy, data privacy and traffic privacy. It is also a decentralized and open network. Anyone can act as a Node participate in the network to relay data transmissions, or a Terminal to use private connections.

WhiteNoise Protocol has superior robustness, ease of use, and cross-platform. It can provide safe and reliable transmission capabilities in a very friendly manner, allowing upper-layer applications to easily and confidently focus on their own business innovations. The privacy of the data is fully guaranteed by WhiteNoise.
## Build
Building WhiteNoise require a Go compiler (version 1.14 or later). Then, simply run

```
make
```
## Example
We implement an example for WhiteNoise network, which is a p2p chatting application.

Follow this [instruction](./chat-example.md) to build your local WhiteNoise network, and run a p2p chat example in it. Feel free to try!
